## 📝 Project Description

This project is part of the COMP3104 DevOps course. Each team member contributes by creating individual branches, adding text files that cover different topics, and practicing Git-based collaboration techniques. The project includes creating at least 10 meaningful commits per member to ensure continuous and incremental contributions.
The primary goal of this project is to teach students the importance of version control, continuous integration, and collaborative workflows in software development. By using GitHub and Git commands, students gain hands-on experience in managing codebases in a team environment.
